	Abstract = {The recently developed GFDL Atmospheric Model version 3 (AM3), an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), incorporates a prognostic treatment of cloud drop number to simulate the aerosol indirect effect. Since cloud drop activation depends on cloud-scale vertical velocities, which are not reproduced in present-day GCMs, additional assumptions on the subgrid variability are required to implement a local activation parameterization into a GCM. This paper describes the subgrid activation assumptions in AM3 and explores sensitivities by constructing alternate configurations. These alternate model configurations exhibit only small differences in their present-day climatology. However, the total anthropogenic radiative flux perturbation (RFP) between present-day and preindustrial conditions varies by +/- 50\% from the reference, because of a large difference in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect. The spread in RFP does not originate directly from the subgrid assumptions but indirectly through the cloud retuning necessary to maintain a realistic radiation balance. In particular, the paper shows a linear correlation between the choice of autoconversion threshold radius and the RFP. Climate sensitivity changes only minimally between the reference and alternate configurations. If implemented in a fully coupled model, these alternate configurations would therefore likely produce substantially different warming from preindustrial to present day.},

	Abstract = {A new bulk microphysical parameterization for large-eddy simulation
   (LES) models of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer has been
   developed using an explicit (drop spectrum resolving) microphysical
   model as a data source and benchmark for comparison. The liquid water is
   divided into two categories, nonprecipitable cloud water and drizzle,
   similar to traditional Kessler-type parameterizations. The cloud
   condensation nucleus (CCN) count, cloud/drizzle water mixing ratios,
   cloud/drizzle drop concentrations, and the cloud drop integral radius
   are predicted in the new scheme. The source/sink terms such as
   autoconversion/accretion of cloud water into/by drizzle are regressed
   using the cloud drop size spectra predicted by an explicit microphysical
   model. The results from the explicit and the new bulk microphysics
   schemes are compared for two cases: nondrizzling and heavily drizzling
   stratocumulus-topped boundary layers (STBLs). The evolution of the STBL
   (characterized by such parameters as turbulence intensity, drizzle
   rates, CCN depletion rates, fractional cloud cover, and drizzle effects
   on internal stratification) simulated by the bulk microphysical model
   was in good agreement with the explicit microphysical model.},

@article{Zelinka2014,
	Abstract = {The interaction of anthropogenic aerosols with radiation and clouds is the largest source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of the climate during the industrial period. Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of -1.40 +/- 0.56 W m(-2) comes roughly 25\% from ERFari (-0.35 +/- 0.20 W m(-2)) and 75\% from ERFaci (-1.04 +/- 0.67 W m(-2)). ERFari is made up of -0.62 +/- 0.30 W m(-2) due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 +/- 0.09 W m(-2), consisting of -0.15 +/- 0.11 W m(-2) of scattering and +0.29 +/- 0.15 W m(-2) of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40-50\%. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of -0.99 +/- 0.54 W m(-2) from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.},

	Abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset
   by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller
   droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as
   cloud condensation nuclei(1). The resulting cooling tendency, termed the
   indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to
   the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate
   because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud
   populations are poorly understood(2). Smaller cloud droplets not only
   reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which
   is expected to result in increased cloud water(3,4). Such an increase in
   cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further
   increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted
   by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more
   water(5-7). Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics
   model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and
   radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud
   water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet
   concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from
   decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of
   overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet
   concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the
   surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations.
   Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of
   precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air.
   In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations
   increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

                  climate. Observation-based studies have typically found a
                  smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model
                  simulations and were given preferential weighting in the
                  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth
                  Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of
                  uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates
                  are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and
                  observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty
                  in the impact of aerosols on the climate. These reported
                  discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating
                  the components of aerosol forcing used in model and
                  observational studies. Applying the observational
                  decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two
                  different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a
                  much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on
                  cloud properties. Cloud adjustments re-main a significant
                  source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However,
                  they are consistent with the uncertainty from
                  observation-based methods, with the liquid water path
                  adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50
                  {\%}. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work
                  suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be
                  more equally weighted in future synthesis studies.",

	Abstract = {The effect of cloud droplet sedimentation on the entrainment rate and
   liquid water path of a nocturnal nondrizzling stratocumulus layer is
   examined using large-eddy simulations (LES) with bulk microphysics. In
   agreement with a prior study by Ackerman et al. (2004), sedimentation is
   found to decrease entrainment rate and thereby increase liquid water
   path. They suggested this is due to reduction of boundary-layer
   turbulence. Our simulations suggest otherwise. Instead, sedimentation
   reduces entrainment by removing liquid water from the entrainment zone.
   This inhibits two mechanisms that promote the sinking of entrained air
   into the cloud layer entrainment-induced evaporative cooling and
   longwave radiative cooling. A sensitivity study shows that the radiative
   effect is less important than the reduced evaporation. A possible
   parameterization of the effect of sedimentation on entrainment rate in a
   mixed layer model is proposed and tested. Since the droplet
   sedimentation rate is inversely related to cloud droplet (and presumably
   aerosol) concentration and nearly nondrizzling marine stratocumulus are
   widespread, sedimentation impacts on stratocumulus entrainment
   efficiency should be considered in climate model simulations of the
   aerosol indirect effect.},

	Abstract = {A modified microphysics scheme is implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5). The new scheme features prognostic precipitation. The coupling between the microphysics and the rest of the model is modified to make it more flexible. Single-column tests show the new microphysics can simulate a constrained drizzling stratocumulus case. Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to significantly reduce aerosol cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33\% (depending on substepping) to below 1 W m(-2) of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions.},

ACI are sensitive to both cloud microphysical processes (the ``C'' in ACI) and aerosol emissions and processes (the ``A'' in ACI). This work highlights the importance of cloud microphysical processes, using idealized and global tests of a cloud microphysics scheme used for global climate prediction. Uncertainties in key cloud microphysical processes examined with sensitivity tests cause uncertainties of nearly -30 to +60\% in ACI, similar to or stronger than uncertainties identified due to natural aerosol emissions (-30 to +30 \%). The different dimensions and sensitivities of ACI to microphysical processes identified in previous work are analyzed in detail, showing that precipitation processes are critical for understanding ACI and that uncertain cloud lifetime effects are nearly one-third of simulated ACI.

	Abstract = {Aerosols can influence cloud radiative effects and, thus, may alter interpretation of how Earth's radiative budget responds to climate forcing. Three different ensemble experiments from the same climate model with different greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios are used to analyze the role of aerosols in climate feedbacks and their spread across initial condition ensembles of transient climate simulations. The standard deviation of global feedback parameters across ensemble members is low, typically 0.02 W m(-2) K-1. Feedbacks from high (8.5 W m(-2)) and moderate (4.5 W m(-2)) year 2100 forcing cases are nearly identical. An aerosol kernel is introduced to remove effects of aerosol cloud interactions that alias into cloud feedbacks. Adjusted cloud feedbacks indicate an ``aerosol feedback'' resulting from changes to climate that increase sea-salt emissions, mostly in the Southern Ocean. Ensemble simulations also indicate higher tropical cloud feedbacks with higher aerosol loading. These effects contribute to a difference in cloud feedbacks of nearly 50\% between ensembles of the same model. These two effects are also seen in aquaplanet simulations with varying fixed drop number. Thus aerosols can be a significant modifier of cloud feedbacks, and different representations of aerosols and their interactions with clouds may contribute to multimodel spread in climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity in multimodel archives.},

	Abstract = {Most estimates of the global mean indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosol on the Earth's energy balance are from simulations by global models of the aerosol lifecycle coupled with global models of clouds and the hydrologic cycle. Extremely simple models have been developed for integrated assessment models, but lack the flexibility to distinguish between primary and secondary sources of aerosol. Here a simple but more physically based model expresses the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) using analytic representations of cloud and aerosol distributions and processes. Although the simple model is able to produce estimates of AIEs that are comparable to those from some global aerosol models using the same global mean aerosol properties, the estimates by the simple model are sensitive to preindustrial cloud condensation nuclei concentration, preindustrial accumulation mode radius, width of the accumulation mode, size of primary particles, cloud thickness, primary and secondary anthropogenic emissions, the fraction of the secondary anthropogenic emissions that accumulates on the coarse mode, the fraction of the secondary mass that forms new particles, and the sensitivity of liquid water path to droplet number concentration. Estimates of present-day AIEs as low as -5 W m(-2) and as high as -0.3 W m(-2) are obtained for plausible sets of parameter values. Estimates are surprisingly linear in emissions. The estimates depend on parameter values in ways that are consistent with results from detailed global aerosol-climate simulation models, which adds to understanding of the dependence on AIE uncertainty on uncertainty in parameter values.},

	Abstract = {A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},

These desired properties are observables, such as the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere, the global mean temperature, sea ice, clouds and wind fields. The tuning is typically performed by adjusting uncertain, or even non-observable, parameters related to processes not explicitly represented at the model grid resolution. The practice of climate model tuning has seen an increasing level of attention because key model properties, such as climate sensitivity, have been shown to depend on frequently used tuning parameters. Here we provide insights into how climate model tuning is practically done in the case of closing the radiation balance and adjusting the global mean temperature for the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model. The impacts of parameter tuning on climate sensitivity was less than anticipated.},

	Abstract = {Climate models continue to exhibit strong sensitivity to the representation of aerosol effects on cloud reflectance and cloud amount. This paper evaluates a proposed method to constrain modeled cloud liquid water path (LWP) adjustments in response to changes in aerosol concentration N-a using observations of precipitation susceptibility. Recent climate modeling has suggested a linear relationship between relative LWP responses to relative changes in N-a, i.e., dlnLWP/dln N-a, and the precipitation frequency susceptibility S-pop, which is defined as the relative change in the probability of precipitation for a relative change in N-a. Using large-eddy simulations (LES) of marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds, we show that these two cloud regimes exhibit qualitatively different relationships between lambda and S-pop; in stratocumulus clouds, lambda increases with S-pop, while in trade wind cumulus, lambda decreases with S-pop. The LES-derived relationship for marine stratocumulus is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different than that derived from climate model simulations of oceanic clouds aggregated over much larger spatial scales. We explore possible reasons for variability in these relationships, including the selected precipitation threshold and the various definitions of precipitation susceptibility that are currently in use. Because aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are inherently small-scale processes, we recommend that when deriving the relationship between lambda and S-pop, careful attention be given to the cloud regime, the scale, and the extent of aggregation of the model output or the observed data.},

	Abstract = {We examined the performance of autoconversion (mass transfer from cloud water to rainwater by the coalescence of cloud droplets) schemes in warm rain, which are commonly used in general circulation models. To exclude biases in the different treatment of the aerosol-cloud-precipitation-radiation interaction other than that of the autoconversion process, sensitivity experiments were conducted within a single model framework using an aerosol-climate model, MIROC-SPRINTARS. The liquid water path (LWP) and cloud optical thickness have a particularly high sensitivity to the autoconversion schemes, and their sensitivity is of the same magnitude as model biases. In addition, the ratio of accretion to autoconversion (Acc/Aut ratio), a key parameter in the examination of the balance of microphysical conversion processes, also has a high sensitivity globally depending on the scheme used. Although the Acc/Aut ratio monotonically increases with increasing LWP, significantly lower ratio is observed in Kessler-type schemes. Compared to satellite observations, a poor representation of cloud macrophysical structure and optically thicker low cloud are found in simulations with any autoconversion scheme. As a result of the cloud-radiation interaction, the difference in the global mean net cloud radiative forcing (NetCRF) among the schemes reaches 10 Wm(-2). The discrepancy between the observed and simulated NetCRF is especially large with a high LWP. The potential uncertainty in the parameterization of the autoconversion process is nonnegligible, and no formulation significantly improves the bias in the cloud radiative effect yet. This means that more fundamental errors are still left in other processes of the model.},

@article{Michibata2016,
	Abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions are one of the most uncertain processes in climate models due to their nonlinear complexity. A key complexity arises from the possibility that clouds can respond to perturbed aerosols in two opposite ways, as characterized by the traditional ``cloud lifetime'' hypothesis and more recent ``buffered system'' hypothesis. Their importance in climate simulations remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the response of the liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol perturbations for warm clouds from the perspective of general circulation model (GCM) and A-Train remote sensing, through process-oriented model evaluations. A systematic difference is found in the LWP response between the model results and observations. The model results indicate a near-global uniform increase of LWP with increasing aerosol loading, while the sign of the response of the LWP from the A-Train varies from region to region. The satellite-observed response of the LWP is closely related to meteorological and/or macrophysical factors, in addition to the microphysics. The model does not reproduce this variability of cloud susceptibility (i.e., sensitivity of LWP to perturbed aerosols) because the parameterization of the autoconversion process assumes only suppression of rain formation in response to increased cloud droplet number, and does not consider macrophysical aspects that serve as a mechanism for the negative responses of the LWP via enhancements of evaporation and precipitation. Model biases are also found in the precipitation microphysics, which suggests that the model generates rainwater readily even when little cloud water is present. This essentially causes projections of unrealistically frequent and light rain, with high cloud susceptibilities to aerosol perturbations.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the sensitivity of the total anthropogenic aerosol effect to the treatment of rain within the global climate model (GCM) ECHAM5. A comparison between a prognostic (rain is stored within the atmosphere) and a diagnostic rain scheme (rain is precipitated out within one model time step) is conducted. Furthermore, the shape of the rain drop distribution within the prognostic rain scheme is varied. The prognostic rain scheme shifts the emphasis of the rain production process from autoconversion to accretion in better agreement with observations. Since the parameterization of the accretion process is independent of the cloud droplet number concentration, the total anthropogenic aerosol effect decreased by 0.5 to 0.9 Wm(-2). Varying the rain drop distribution has a smaller influence on the total anthropogenic aerosol effect, changing it by 0.2 to 0.3 Wm(-2). Citation: Posselt, R., and U.

	Abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects continue to constitute one of the most
   important uncertainties for anthropogenic climate perturbations. Within
   the international AEROCOM initiative, the representation of
   aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general
   circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets.
   The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not
   include ice nucleation effects, and none of the model explicitly
   parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute
   statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) and
   various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent
   between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the
   model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number
   concentration (N-d) compares relatively well to the satellite data at
   least over the ocean. The relationship between tau(a) and liquid water
   path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that
   the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms
   of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A
   positive relationship between total cloud fraction (f(cld)) and tau(a)
   as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the
   models, albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of
   them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to
   explain the satellite-derived strong f(cld)-tau(a) relationship, our
   results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation.
   Relationships similar to the ones found in satellite data between tau(a)
   and cloud top temperature or outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) are
   simulated by only a few GCMs. The GCMs that simulate a negative
   OLR-tau(a) relationship show a strong positive correlation between
   tau(a) and f(cld). The short-wave total aerosol radiative forcing as
   simulated by the GCMs is strongly influenced by the simulated
   anthropogenic fraction of tau(a), and parameterisation assumptions such

	Abstract = {A new stratiform cloud scheme including a two-moment bulk microphysics module, a cloud cover parameterization allowing ice supersaturation, and an ice nucleation parameterization has been implemented into the recently developed GFDL AM3 general circulation model (GCM) as part of an effort to treat aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions more realistically. Unlike the original scheme, the new scheme facilitates the study of cloud-ice-aerosol interactions via influences of dust and sulfate on ice nucleation. While liquid and cloud ice water path associated with stratiform clouds are similar for the new and the original scheme, column integrated droplet numbers and global frequency distributions (PDFs) of droplet effective radii differ significantly. This difference is in part due to a difference in the implementation of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) mechanism, which leads to a larger contribution from super-cooled droplets in the original scheme. Clouds are more likely to be either completely glaciated or liquid due to the WBF mechanism in the new scheme. Super-saturations over ice simulated with the new scheme are in qualitative agreement with observations, and PDFs of ice numbers and effective radii appear reasonable in the light of observations. Especially, the temperature dependence of ice numbers qualitatively agrees with in-situ observations. The global average long-wave cloud forcing decreases in comparison to the original scheme as expected when super-saturation over ice is allowed. Anthropogenic aerosols lead to a larger decrease in short-wave absorption (SWABS) in the new model setup, but outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) decreases as well, so that the net effect of including anthropogenic aerosols on the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere (netradTOA = SWABS-OLR) is of similar magnitude for the new and the original scheme.},

	Abstract = {A new parameterization with three prognostic liquid water classes was implemented into the general circulation model (GCM) ECHAM5 with the aerosol module HAM in order to improve the global representation of rain formation in marine stratiform clouds. The additionally introduced drizzle class improves the physical representation of the droplet spectrum and, more importantly, improves the microphysical processes relevant for precipitation formation compared to the standard parameterization. In order to avoid a mismatch of the liquid and ice phase, a prognostic treatment of snow has been introduced too. This has a significant effect on the amount and altitude of ice clouds, which in turn affects not only the in-and outgoing radiation but also the parameterized collection rates. With the introduction of a prognostic precipitation scheme, a more realistic representation of both liquid and ice phase large-scale precipitation is achieved compared to a diagnostic treatment. An encouraging finding is that with the prognostic treatment the increase of the liquid water path in response to anthropogenic aerosols is reduced by about 25 \%. Although the total net radiative forcing is decreased from -1.3 +/- 0.3 to -1.6 +/- 0.3W m(-2) from the control to the prognostic model version, the difference is within the interannual variability. Altogether the results suggest that the treatment of precipitation in global circulation models has not only a significant influence on the phase of clouds and their conversion rates, but also hints towards uncertainties related to a prognostic precipitation scheme.},

	Abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects have remained the largest uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Observational constraints on cloud lifetime effects are particularly challenging since it is difficult to separate aerosol effects from meteorological influences. Here we use three global climate models, including a multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF, to show that the dependence of the probability of precipitation on aerosol loading, termed the precipitation frequency susceptibility (S-pop), is a good measure of the liquid water path response to aerosol perturbation (lambda), as both S-pop and lambda strongly depend on the magnitude of autoconversion, a model representation of precipitation formation via collisions among cloud droplets. This provides a method to use satellite observations to constrain cloud lifetime effects in global climate models. S-pop in marine clouds estimated from CloudSat, MODIS and AMSR-E observations is substantially lower than that from global climate models and suggests a liquid water path increase of less than 5\% from doubled cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. This implies a substantially smaller impact on shortwave cloud radiative forcing over ocean due to aerosol indirect effects than simulated by current global climate models (a reduction by one-third for one of the conventional aerosol-climate models). Further work is needed to quantify the uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates of S-pop and to examine S-pop in high-resolution models. Citation: Wang, M., et al.

There is an increasing recognition that this process needs to become more transparent for both users of climate model output and other developers. Knowing how and why climate models are tuned and which targets are used is essential to avoiding possible misattributions of skillful predictions to data accommodation and vice versa. This paper describes the approach and practice of model tuning for the six major US climate modeling centers. While details differ among groups in terms of scientific missions, tuning targets, and tunable parameters, there is a core commonality of approaches. However, practices differ significantly on some key aspects, in particular, in the use of initialized forecast analyses as a tool, the explicit use of the historical transient record, and the use of the present-day radiative imbalance vs. the implied balance in the preindustrial era as a target.},

	Abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset
   by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller
   droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as
   cloud condensation nuclei(1). The resulting cooling tendency, termed the
   indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to
   the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate
   because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud
   populations are poorly understood(2). Smaller cloud droplets not only
   reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which
   is expected to result in increased cloud water(3,4). Such an increase in
   cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further
   increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted
   by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more
   water(5-7). Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics
   model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and
   radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud
   water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet
   concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from
   decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of
   overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet
   concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the
   surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations.
   Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of
   precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air.
   In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations
   increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

The LWP simulated by CAM increases substantially with aerosol loading while that in the CRM does not. The increase of LWP in CAM is caused by a large decrease of the autoconversion rate when cloud droplet number increases. In the CRM, the autoconversion rate is also reduced, but this is offset or even outweighed by the increased evaporation of cloud droplets near the cloud top, resulting in an overall decrease in LWP. Our results suggest that climate models need to include the dependence of cloud top growth and the evaporation/condensation process on cloud droplet number concentrations.},

This work aims at understanding this dynamical-microphysical interaction and providing information necessary for parameterizations of the ensemble mean condensation rate and turbulent fluxes of liquid water variables in a coupled turbulence-microphysics model. The approach is to simulate nonprecipitating stratocumulus clouds with a coupled large eddy simulation and an explicit bin-microphysical model, and then perform a budget analysis for four liquid water variables: mean liquid water content, turbulent liquid water flux, mean cloud droplet number concentration, and the number density flux. The results show that the turbulence contribution to the mean condensation rate comes from covariance of the integral cloud droplet radius and supersaturation, which enhances condensation in turbulent updrafts and reduces evaporation in the downdrafts. Turbulent liquid water flux results from a close balance between turbulence dynamics and microphysical processes. Consequently, the flux can be parameterized in terms of the common diffusive downgradient formulation, fluxes of conservative thermodynamic variables, the turbulence mixing timescale, and the condensation timescale, which is determined by the droplet spectrum. The results also suggest that the condensation timescale regulates the turbulence fields, as does the number concentration, because it affects the condensation fluctuation, which is highly correlated with the turbulence vertical motion. A saturation adjustment cloud model, which diagnoses liquid water content at its equilibrium level, instantly condenses (evaporates) all available water vapor (liquid water) surplus. Consequently, there is likely to be a systematic difference between the turbulence field resolved with this type of model and that with a supersaturation-based cloud scheme for which a finite condensation timescale applies.",

In this study, the aerosol impacts on cloud microphysics are examined in the context of the boundary-layer diurnal cycle using 36-h LES simulations of pristine and polluted clouds. These simulations corroborate previous findings that during nighttime aerosol-induced liquid water path changes are sensitive to the large-scale forcings via enhancement of cloud-top entrainment such that, ultimately, the liquid water path may be reduced when the free-tropospheric-entrained air is drier. During the day, however, enhanced entrainment, inhibition of drizzle evaporation below cloud base, and reduced sensible heat flux from the surface lead to a more pronounced decoupling of the boundary layer, which significantly amplifies the liquid water path reduction of the polluted clouds. At night the sign of the liquid water path difference between pristine and polluted clouds depends upon large-scale forcings, while during the day the liquid water path of polluted clouds is always smaller than the one of the pristine clouds. Suggestions are made on how observational studies could be designed for validation of these simulations.",

abstract="Cloud responses to changes in aerosol remain a dominant uncertainty in the radiative forcing of climate. Two main constructs related to aerosol effects on clouds have been postulated: (i) the ``albedo effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol results in increased droplet concentrations that generate increases in cloud albedo, all else (particularly cloud water) being equal; (ii) the ''lifetime effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol suppresses precipitation and results in clouds with more liquid water, higher fractional cloudiness, and longer lifetimes. Based on new observations presented here, and supported by previous fine-scale modeling studies, we suggest that the balance of evidence shows that non-precipitating cumulus clouds can experience an evaporation-entrainment feedback, and respond to aerosol perturbations in a manner inconsistent with the traditional ``lifetime effect.'' Because most cumulus clouds evaporate without producing significant precipitation, this is particularly relevant to estimates of aerosol indirect effects on climate. Citation: Small, J. D., P. Y.

Because aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei can have a strong influence on the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), previous studies have used the sensitivity of the Nd to aerosol properties as a constraint on the strength of the RFaci. However, recent studies have suggested that relationships between aerosol and cloud properties in the present-day climate may not be suitable for determining the sensitivity of the Nd to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations. Using an ensemble of global aerosol-climate models, this study demonstrates how joint histograms between Nd and aerosol properties can account for many of the issues raised by previous studies. It shows that if the anthropogenic contribution to the aerosol is known, the RFaci can be diagnosed to within 20\% of its actual value. The accuracy of different aerosol proxies for diagnosing the RFaci is investigated, confirming that using the aerosol optical depth significantly underestimates the strength of the aerosol-cloud interactions in satellite data.},

   evaporation-entrainment effect and a sedimentation-entrainment effect
   that result from increasing aerosol concentrations and (ii) the nature
   of mixing between clear and cloudy air, where homogeneous and extreme
   inhomogeneous mixing represent the bounding mixing types. Simulations
   are performed at low resolution (Delta z = 20 m; Delta x, y = 40 m) and
   high resolution (Delta z = 10 m; Delta x, y = 20 m). It is demonstrated
   that an increase in aerosol from clean conditions (100 cm(-3)) to
   polluted conditions (1000 cm(-3)) produces both an
   evaporation-entrainment and a sedimentation-entrainment effect, which
   couple to cause about a 10\% decrease in liquid water path (LWP) when

   are insensitive to both the resolutions tested and the mixing

   cloud-averaged drop number concentration, a small increase in cloud drop
   effective radius, and; 1\% decrease in cloud optical depth. For the case
   presented, these small changes play a negligible role when compared to
   the impact of increasing aerosol and the associated entrainment effects.
   Finally, it is demonstrated that although increasing resolution causes
   an increase in LWP and number concentration, the relative sensitivity of
   cloud optical depth to changes in aerosol is unaffected by resolution.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of aerosol on clouds, precipitation,
   and the organization of trade wind cumuli using large eddy simulations
   (LES). Results show that for this shallow-cumulus-under-stratocumulus
   case, cloud fraction increases with increasing aerosol as the aerosol
   number mixing ratio increases from 25 (domain-averaged surface
   precipitation rate similar to 0.65 mm day(-1)) to 100 mg(-1) (negligible
   surface precipitation). Further increases in aerosol result in a
   reduction in cloud fraction. It is suggested that opposing influences of
   aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation and aerosol-induced
   enhancement of evaporation are responsible for this nonmonotonic
   behavior. Under clean conditions (25 mg(-1)), drizzle is shown to
   initiate and maintain mesoscale organization of cumulus convection.
   Precipitation induces downdrafts and cold pool outflow as the cumulus
   cell develops. At the surface, the center of the cell is characterized
   by a divergence field, while the edges of the cell are zones of
   convergence. Convergence drives the formation and development of new
   cloud cells, leading to a mesoscale open cellular structure. These zones
   of new cloud formation generate new precipitation zones that continue to
   reinforce the cellular structure. For simulations with an aerosol
   concentration of 100 mg(-1) the cloud fields do not show any cellular
   organization. On average, no evidence is found for aerosol effects on
   the lifetime of these clouds, suggesting that cloud fraction response to
   changes in aerosol is tied to the frequency of convection and/or cloud
   size.},

abstract="The effects of aerosol on warm trade cumulus clouds are investigated using a large-eddy simulation with size-resolved cloud microphysics. It is shown that, as expected, increases in aerosols cause a reduction in precipitation and an increase in the cloud-averaged liquid water path (LWP). However, for the case under study, cloud fraction, cloud size, cloud-top height, and depth decrease in response to increasing aerosol concentration, contrary to accepted hypotheses associated with the second aerosol indirect effect. It is found that the complex responses of clouds to aerosols are determined by competing effects of precipitation and droplet evaporation associated with entrainment. As aerosol concentration increases, precipitation suppression tends to maintain the clouds and lead to higher cloud LWP, whereas cloud droplets become smaller and evaporate more readily, which tends to dissipate the clouds and leads to lower cloud fraction, cloud size, and depth. An additional set of experiments with higher surface latent heat flux, and hence higher LWP and drizzle rate, was also performed. Changes in cloud properties due to aerosols have the same trends as in the base runs, although the magnitudes of the changes are larger. Evidence for significant stabilization (or destabilization) of the subeloud layer due to drizzle is not found, mainly because drizzling clouds cover only a small fraction of the domain. It is suggested that cloud fraction may only increase with increasing aerosol loading for larger clouds that are less susceptible to entrainment and evaporation. Finally, it is noted that at any given aerosol concentration the dynamical variability in bulk cloud parameters such as LWP tends to be larger than the aerosol-induced changes in these parameters, indicating that the second aerosol indirect effect may be hard to measure in this cloud type. The variability in cloud optical depth is, however, dominated by changes in aerosol, rather than dynamics.",

abstract="CloudSat's 94-GHz Cloud Profiling Radar provides unique near-global observations of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here CloudSat-based diagnostics for near-surface precipitation frequency are implemented in publicly available software that is widely used for climate model evaluation. The new diagnostics are definition aware and scale aware. As a result, the diagnostics enable robust assessment of modeled near-surface precipitation frequency at a range of intensity classes. The new diagnostics are used to evaluate precipitation frequency in a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). CESM1 rains and snows too frequently, a bias that is especially pronounced for light rain. Conversely, while rare in both observations and CESM1, the heaviest rainfall events occur too infrequently in CESM1. Though the spatial distribution of snowfall events matches observations well, CESM1 also exhibits excessive snow frequency biases. Despite these biases, projected CESM1 changes in reflectivity-based diagnostics provide interesting insights into what a future 94-GHz radar could detect in a warmer world. With 3 degrees C of global warming, a future CloudSat-class mission would detect substantial conversion of snow to rain at midlatitudes, a narrowing of the Tropical Pacific rain belt, increased light rain in subtropics, and increased snow frequency in polar regions. The future CESM1 simulations also provide evidence that present-day spatial and magnitude biases imprint themselves on precipitation frequency changes. In summary, new precipitation frequency diagnostics for a range of precipitation intensities robustly expose climate model biases and inform expectations for observable future precipitation changes in a warming world.",

abstract="Clouds constitute a large uncertainty in global climate modeling and climate change projections as many clouds are smaller than the size of a model grid box. Some processes, such as the rates of rain and snow formation that have a large impact on climate, cannot be observed. The uncertain parameters in the representation of these processes are therefore adjusted in order to achieve radiation balance. Here we systematically investigate the impact of key tunable parameters within the convective and stratiform cloud schemes and of the ice cloud optical properties on the present-day climate in terms of clouds, radiation and precipitation. The total anthropogenic aerosol effect between pre-industrial and present-day times amounts to -1.00 W m(-2) obtained as an average over all simulations as compared to -1.02 W m(-2) from those simulations where the global annual mean top-of-the atmosphere radiation balance is within -1.02 W m(-2). Thus tuning of the present-day climate does not seem to have an influence on the total anthropogenic aerosol effect. The parametric uncertainty regarding the above mentioned cloud parameters has an uncertainty range of 25\% between the minimum and maximum value when taking all simulations into account. It is reduced to 11\% when only the simulations with a balanced top-of-the atmosphere radiation are considered.",

abstract="One of the challenges in representing warm rain processes in global climate models (GCMs) is related to the representation of the subgrid variability of cloud properties, such as cloud water and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), and the effect thereof on individual precipitation processes such as autoconversion. This effect is conventionally treated by multiplying the resolved-scale warm rain process rates by an enhancement factor (E-q) which is derived from integrating over an assumed subgrid cloud water distribution. The assumed subgrid cloud distribution remains highly uncertain. In this study, we derive the subgrid variations of liquid-phase cloud properties over the tropical ocean using the satellite remote sensing products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and investigate the corresponding enhancement factors for the GCM parameterization of autoconversion rate. We find that the conventional approach of using only subgrid variability of cloud water is insufficient and that the subgrid variability of CDNC, as well as the correlation between the two, is also important for correctly simulating the autoconversion process in GCMs. Using the MODIS data which have near-global data coverage, we find that Eq shows a strong dependence on cloud regimes due to the fact that the subgrid variability of cloud water and CDNC is regime dependent. Our analysis shows a significant increase of Eq from the stratocumulus (Sc) to cumulus (Cu) regions. Furthermore, the enhancement factor E-N due to the subgrid variation of CDNC is derived from satellite observation for the first time, and results reveal several regions downwind of biomass burning aerosols (e. g., Gulf of Guinea, east coast of South Africa), air pollution (i. e., East China Sea), and active volcanos (e. g., Kilauea, Hawaii, and Ambae, Vanuatu), where the E-N is comparable to or even larger than E-q, suggesting an important role of aerosol in influencing the EN. MODIS observations suggest that the subgrid variations of cloud liquid water path (LWP) and CDNC are generally positively correlated. As a result, the combined enhancement factor, including the effect of LWP and CDNC correlation, is significantly smaller than the simple product of E-q center dot E-N. Given the importance of warm rain processes in understanding the Earth's system dynamics and water cycle, we conclude that more observational studies are needed to provide a better constraint on the warm rain processes in GCMs.",

abstract="Aerosol-cloud interaction is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic radiative forcing of Earth's climate, and aerosol-induced cloud water changes are particularly poorly constrained in climate models. By combining satellite retrievals of volcano and ship tracks in stratocumulus clouds, we compile a unique observational data set and confirm that liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosols are bidirectional, and on average the increases in LWP are closely compensated by the decreases. Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45\%. Plain Language Summary It remains unclear how much of the global warming induced by greenhouse gases is offset by aerosols because the effect of aerosol particles on clouds is the most uncertain mechanism of forcing of Earth's climate by human activities. Cloud water responses to aerosols are especially uncertain. Here we compare the properties of low marine clouds impacted by volcanic and ship emissions with the properties of the nearby unpolluted clouds in order to increase the understanding of aerosol impacts on clouds. Clouds impacted by emissions from volcanoes and ships lose or gain water depending on meteorological conditions, but on average the amount of water does not change much in the polluted clouds. These observations disagree with the systematic increases in cloud water in response to aerosols simulated by the Hadley Centre climate model. This model, like other contemporary climate models, only accounts for cloud water increases that result from decreased precipitation efficiency and does not account for the enhanced drying in polluted clouds. Our results suggest that the ability of aerosols to offset global warming might be overestimated. The observational constraints derived here on aerosol-induced cloud water changes would ultimately translate into reduced uncertainties in projections of the future climate.",

abstract="Satellite cloud observations have become an indispensable tool for evaluating general circulation models (GCMs). To facilitate the satellite and GCM comparisons, the CFMIP (Cloud Feedback Model Inter-comparison Project) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been developed and is now increasingly used in GCM evaluations. Real-world clouds and precipitation can have significant sub-grid variations, which, however, are often ignored or oversimplified in the COSP simulation. In this study, we use COSP cloud simulations from the Super-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM5) and satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CloudSat to demonstrate the importance of considering the sub-grid variability of cloud and precipitation when using the COSP to evaluate GCM simulations. We carry out two sensitivity tests: SPCAM5 COSP and SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP. In the SPCAM5 COSP run, the sub-grid cloud and precipitation properties from the embedded cloud-resolving model (CRM) of SPCAM5 are used to drive the COSP simulation, while in the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run only grid-mean cloud and precipitation properties (i.e., no sub-grid variations) are given to the COSP. We find that the warm rain signatures in the SPCAM5 COSP run agree with the MODIS and CloudSat observations quite well. In contrast, the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run which ignores the sub-grid cloud variations substantially overestimates the radar reflectivity and probability of precipitation compared to the satellite observations, as well as the results from the SPCAM5 COSP run. The significant differences between the two COSP runs demonstrate that it is important to take into account the sub-grid variations of cloud and precipitation when using COSP to evaluate the GCM to avoid confusing and misleading results.",

abstract="Changes in aerosols cause a change in net top-of-the-atmosphere (ToA) short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes; rapid adjustments in clouds, water vapour and temperature; and an effective radiative forcing (ERF) of the planetary energy budget. The diverse sources of model uncertainty and the computational cost of running climate models make it difficult to isolate the main causes of aerosol ERF uncertainty and to understand how observations can be used to constrain it. We explore the aerosol ERF uncertainty by using fast model emulators to generate a very large set of aerosol-climate model variants that span the model uncertainty due to 27 parameters related to atmospheric and aerosol processes. Sensitivity analyses shows that the uncertainty in the ToA flux is dominated (around 80 \%) by uncertainties in the physical atmosphere model, particularly parameters that affect cloud reflectivity. However, uncertainty in the change in ToA flux caused by aerosol emissions over the industrial period (the aerosol ERF) is controlled by a combination of uncertainties in aerosol (around 60 \%) and physical atmosphere (around 40 \%) parameters. Four atmospheric and aerosol parameters account for around 80\% of the uncertainty in short-wave ToA flux (mostly parameters that directly scale cloud reflectivity, cloud water content or cloud droplet concentrations), and these parameters also account for around 60\% of the aerosol ERF uncertainty. The common causes of uncertainty mean that constraining the modelled planetary brightness to tightly match satellite observations changes the lower 95\% credible aerosol ERF value from -2.65 to -2.37 W m(-2). This suggests the strongest forcings (below around -2.4 W m(-2)) are inconsistent with observations. These results show that, regardless of the fact that the ToA flux is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the aerosol ERF, the observed flux can constrain the uncertainty in ERF because their values are connected by constrainable process parameters. The key to reducing the aerosol ERF uncertainty further will be to identify observations that can additionally constrain individual parameter ranges and/or combined parameter effects, which can be achieved through sensitivity analysis of perturbed parameter ensembles.",

abstract="Three different boundary layer cloud models are incorporated into the ECHAM5 general circulation model (GCM) and compared to CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite observations. The first boundary layer model builds upon the standard Tiedtke (1989) parameterization for shallow convection with an adapted convective trigger; the second is a bulk parameterization of the effects of transient shallow cumulus clouds; and lastly the Dual Mass Flux (DMF) scheme adjusted to better represent shallow convection. The three schemes improved (Sub) Tropical oceanic low-level cloud cover, however, the fraction of low-level cloud cover remains underestimated compared to CALIPSO observations. The representation of precipitation was improved by all schemes as they reduced the frequency of light intensity events <0.01 mm d(-1), which were found to dominate the radar reflectivity histograms as well as be the greatest source of differences between ECHAM5 and CloudSat radar reflectivity histograms. For both lidar and radar diagnostics, the differences amongst the schemes are smaller than the differences compared to observations. While the DMF approach remains experimental, as its top-of-atmosphere radiative balance has not been retuned, it shows the most promise in producing nonprecipitating boundary layer clouds. With its internally consistent boundary layer scheme that uses the same bimodal joint distribution with a diffusive and an updraft component for clouds and turbulent transport, the ECHAM5\_DMF produces the most realistic boundary layer depth as indicated by the cloud field. In addition, it reduced the frequency of large-scale precipitation intensities of <0.01 mm d(-1) the greatest.",

abstract="Regimes of tropical low-level clouds are commonly identified according to large-scale subsidence and lower tropospheric stability (LTS). This definition alone is insufficient for the distinction between regimes and limits the comparison of low-level clouds from CloudSat radar observations and the ECHAM5 GCM run with the COSP radar simulator. Comparisons of CloudSat radar cloud altitude-reflectivity histograms for stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes, as defined above, show nearly identical reflectivity profiles, because the distinction between the two regimes is dependent upon atmospheric stability below 700 hPa and observations above 1.5 km. Regional subsets, near California and Hawaii, for example, have large differences in reflectivity profiles than the dynamically defined domain; indicating different reflectivity profiles exist under a given large-scale environment. Regional subsets are better for the evaluation of low-level clouds in CloudSat and ECHAM5 as there is less contamination between 2.5 km and 7.5 km from precipitating hydrometeors which obscured cloud reflectivities.",

Active lidar and radar instruments on board CALIPSO and CloudSat allow the vertical distribution of clouds and their optical properties to be studied on a global scale. To evaluate the clouds modeled by ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat, the lidar and radar satellite simulators of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project's Observation Simulator Package are used. Comparison of ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat found large-scale features resolved by the model, such as the Hadley circulation, are captured well. The lidar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the amount of high-level clouds, particularly optically thin clouds. High-altitude clouds in ECHAM5 consistently produced greater lidar scattering ratios compared with CALIPSO. Consequently, the lidar signal in ECHAM5 frequently attenuated high in the atmosphere. The large scattering ratios were due to an underestimation of effective ice crystal radii in ECHAM5. Doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the scattering ratios and frequency of attenuation. Additionally, doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the detection of ECHAM5's highest-level clouds by the radar simulator, in better agreement with CloudSat. ECHAM5 was also shown to significantly underestimate midlevel clouds and (sub)tropical low-level clouds. The low-level clouds produced were consistently perceived by the lidar simulator as too optically thick. The radar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the frequency of precipitation, yet underestimates its intensity compared with CloudSat observations. These findings imply compensating mechanisms in ECHAM5 balance out the radiative imbalance caused by incorrect optical properties of clouds and consistently large hydrometeors in the atmosphere.",

Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols; these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify aerosol-cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014-2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets-consistent with expectations-but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around -0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.",

abstract="Covariance between cloud and precipitation water in shallow marine boundary layer clouds is assessed using collocated satellite observations from CloudSat and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) at spatial scales typical of global models. An analytic construct is presented, which suggests that global models that do not take subgrid scale cloud-precipitation covariance into account in their microphysical parameterizations may significantly underestimate grid mean microphysical process rates in warm clouds. The proposed framework indicates a mean bias in autoconversion rates of 129\% when subgrid scale cloud water variability is neglected and bias in accretion rates of 60\% when subgrid cloud-precipitation covariability is neglected at a model grid resolution of 141km. The bias in accretion rate is dependent on the significant correlation () found between cloud and precipitation, which in the global mean is found to be =0.44. The regional distribution of the process rate biases is largely governed by the spatial pattern of cloud water variance. Specific areas of low cloud water variance are found in the subtropical eastern ocean basins and the high latitudes, whereas much of the tropics display relatively larger cloud water variance. These regional distinctions in cloud water variance are associated with commensurate regionality in the process rate biases. The magnitude of the bias has a scale dependence that is governed by the spatial scaling behavior of the cloud and precipitation variances, which follow a power law scaling with exponent of 2/3 at scales below about 10km and decreasing exponent above this length scale. While the parametric framework reduces biases in the accretion rate estimated from the grid-mean values of cloud and precipitation water, it is shown that it still undercorrects the accretion rate because it neglects the fact that the precipitation fractional area is less than the cloud fractional area and is preferentially colocated with the highest cloud water concentrations. These results imply that (1) predicting the appropriate balance of autoconversion to accretion in global models requires not only the subgrid scale cloud water variability but also the subgrid scale covariability of cloud and precipitation water and (2) the ability of a global model to calculate the correct regional variation in process rates depends crucially on the fidelity of that model to predict or diagnose the spatial distribution of the variance in cloud water.",

abstract="Atmospheric aerosol particles act as cloud condensation nuclei, affording them the ability to influence cloud microphysics, planetary albedo, and precipitation. Models of varying complexity and satellite observations from NASA's A-Train constellation of satellites are used to determine what controls the precipitation susceptibility of warm clouds to aerosol perturbations. Three susceptibility regimes are identified: (i) clouds with low liquid water path (LWP) generate very little rain and are least susceptible to aerosol; (ii) clouds with intermediate LWP where aerosol most effectively suppress precipitation; and (iii) clouds with high LWP, where the susceptibility begins to decrease because the precipitation process is efficient owing to abundant liquid water. Remarkable qualitative agreement between remote sensing observations and model predictions provides the first suggestions that certain regions of the Earth might be more vulnerable to pollution aerosol. Targeted pollution control strategies in such regions would most benefit water availability via precipitation. Citation: Sorooshian, A., G. Feingold, M. D. Lebsock, H. Jiang, and G. L.

A new Kessler-type parameterization is further derived by eliminating the incorrect and/or unnecessary assumptions inherent in the existing Kessler-type parameterizations. The new parameterization exhibits a different dependence on liquid water content and droplet concentration, and provides theoretical explanations for the multitude of values assigned to the tunable coefficients associated with the commonly used parameterizations. Relative dispersion of the cloud droplet size distribution (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean radius of the cloud droplet size distribution) is explicitly included in the new parameterization, allowing for investigation of the influences of the relative dispersion on the autoconversion rate and, hence, on the second indirect aerosol effect.

abstract="Autoconversion is a highly nonlinear process, which is usually evaluated in global climate models (GCMs) from the mean in-cloud value of the liquid-water mixing ratio q(l)'. This biases the calculated autoconversion rate, and may explain why it usually seems to be necessary to reduce the autoconversion threshold to an unrealistically low value to obtain a realistic simulation in a GCM. Two versions of a threshold-dependent autoconversion parameterization are compared in the CSIRO GCM. In the standard (``OLD'') treatment, autoconversion occurs in a grid box whenever the mean in-cloud q(l)' exceeds the threshold q(crit), which is derived from a prescribed threshold cloud-droplet radius r(crit). In the modified (``NEW'') version, the assumed subgrid moisture distribution from the model's condensation scheme is applied in each grid box to determine the fraction of the cloudy area in which q(l)' > q(crit), and autoconversion occurs in this fraction only. Simulations are performed using both treatments, for present-day and preindustrial distributions of cloud-droplet concentration, and using different values for r(crit). Changing from the OLD to the NEW treatment means that r(crit) can be increased from 7.5 mu m to a more realistic 9.3 mu m, while maintaining the global-mean liquid-water path at about the same value. Simulations for preindustrial and present-day conditions are compared, to see whether the change of scheme alters the modeled cloud-lifetime effect. It is found that the NEW scheme with r(crit) = 9.3 mu m gives a 0.5 W m(-2) (62\%) stronger cloud-lifetime effect than the OLD scheme with r(crit) = 7.5 mu m.",

abstract="Global climate models (GCMs) have been found to share the common too-frequent bias in the warm rain formation process. In this study, five different autoconversion schemes are incorporated into a single GCM, to systematically evaluate the warm rain formation processes in comparison with satellite observations and investigate their effects on the aerosol indirect effect (AIE). It is found that some schemes generate warm rain less efficiently under polluted conditions in the manner closer to satellite observations, while the others generate warm rain too frequently. Large differences in AIE are found among these schemes. It is remarkable that the schemes with more observation-like warm rain formation processes exhibit larger AIEs that far exceed the uncertainty range reported in IPCC AR5, to an extent that can cancel much of the warming trend in the past century, whereas schemes with too-frequent rain formations yield AIEs that are well bounded by the reported range. The power-law dependence of the autoconversion rate on the cloud droplet number concentration beta is found to affect substantially the susceptibility of rain formation to aerosols: the more negative beta is, the more difficult it is for rain to be triggered in polluted clouds, leading to larger AIE through substantial contributions from the wet scavenging feedback. The appropriate use of a droplet size threshold can mitigate the effect of a less negative beta. The role of the warm rain formation process on AIE in this particular model has broad implications for others that share the too-frequent rain-formation bias.",

abstract="An investigation of the impact of the subgrid-scale variability of cloud liquid water on the autoconversion process as parameterized in a general circulation model is presented in this paper. For this purpose, a prognostic statistical probability density distribution (PDF) of the subgrid scale variability of cloud water is incorporated in a continuous autoconversion parameterization. Thus, the revised autoconversion rate is calculated by an integral of the autoconversion equation over the PDF of total water mixing ratio from the saturation vapor mixing ratio to the maximum of total water mixing ratio. An evaluation of the new autoconversion parameterization is carried out by means of one year simulations with the ECHAM5 climate model. The results indicate that the new autoconversion scheme causes an increase of the frequency of occurrence of high autoconversion rates and a decrease of low ones compared to the original scheme. This expected result is due to the emphasis on areas of high cloud liquid water in the new approach, and the non-linearity of the autoconversion with respect to liquid water mixing ratio. A similar trend as in the autoconversion is observed in the accretion process resulting from the coupling of both processes. As a consequence of the altered autoconversion, large-scale surface precipitation also shows a shift of occurrence from lower to higher rates. The vertically integrated cloud liquid water estimated by the model shows slight improvements compared to satellite data. Most importantly, the artificial tuning factor for autoconversion in the continuous parameterization could be reduced by almost an order of magnitude using the revised parameterization.",

abstract="The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate. Significant progress has been made in constraining this forcing using observations, but uncertainty remains, particularly in the magnitude of cloud rapid adjustments to aerosol perturbations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is the leading control on liquid-cloud albedo, making it important to observationally constrain the aerosol impact on LWP. Previous modelling and observational studies have shown that multiple processes play a role in determining the LWP response to aerosol perturbations, but that the aerosol effect can be difficult to isolate. Following previous studies using mediating variables, this work investigates use of the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) and LWP for constraining the role of aerosols. Using joint-probability histograms to account for the non-linear relationship, this work finds a relationship that is broadly consistent with previous studies. There is significant geographical variation in the relationship, partly due to role of meteorological factors (particularly relative humidity). The N-d-LWP relationship is negative in the majority of regions, suggesting that aerosol-induced LWP reductions could offset a significant fraction of the instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci). However, variations in the N-d-LWP relationship in response to volcanic and shipping aerosol perturbations indicate that the N-d-LWP relationship overestimates the causal N-d impact on LWP due to the role of confounding factors. The weaker LWP reduction implied by these ``natural experiments'' means that this work provides an upper bound to the radiative forcing from aerosol-induced changes in the LWP.",

The Cloudsat cloud profiling radar (CPR) has been operating since 2 June 2006 and has proven to be remarkably stable since turn-on. A number of products have been developed using these space-borne radar data as principal inputs. Combined with other A-Train sensor data, these new observations offer unique, global views of the vertical structure of clouds and precipitation jointly. Approximately 11\% of clouds detected over the global oceans produce precipitation that, in all likelihood, reaches the surface. Warm precipitating clouds are both wetter and composed of larger particles than nonprecipitating clouds. The frequency of precipitation increases significantly with increasing cloud depth, and the increased depth and water path of precipitating clouds leads to increased optical depths and substantially more sunlight reflected from precipitating clouds compared to than nonprecipitating warm clouds. The CloudSat observations also provide an authoritative estimate of global ice water paths. The observed ice water paths are larger than those predicted from most climate models. CloudSat observations also indicate that clouds radiatively heat the global mean atmospheric column (relative to clear skies) by about 10 Wm(-2). Although this heating appears to be contributed almost equally by solar and infrared absorption, the latter contribution is shown to vary significantly with latitude being influenced by the predominant cloud structures of the different region in questions.",

For echoes above this intensity threshold, the products derived from reflectivity, particularly maps of rainfall rate and convective/stratiform classification, compare well, even though slightly different convective-stratiform separation techniques and different reflectivity-rainfall rate (Z-R) relations are used for the PR and KR. The KR observations indicate the PR misses only 2.3\% of near-surface rainfall but 46\% of near-surface rain area (greater than or equal to0 dBZ) because of its 17-dBZ threshold. The PR senses less than 15\% of the echo area observed by the KR above 5-km altitude (i.e., above the 0 degreesC level). Thus, the PR highly undersamples weaker echoes associated with stratiform rain near the surface and ice particles aloft but still manages to capture most of the near-surface precipitation accumulation. The temporal sampling of the TRMM PR accurately captures the KR's overall frequency distribution of reflectivity and its subdivision into convective and stratiform components.

abstract="The strength of the effective anthropogenic climate forcing from aerosol cloud interactions is related to the susceptibility of precipitation to aerosol effects. Precipitation susceptibility dlnP/dlnN has been proposed as a metric to quantify the effect of aerosol-induced changes in cloud droplet number N on warm precipitation rate P. Based on the microphysical rate equations of the Seifert and Beheng two-moment bulk microphysics scheme, susceptibilities of warm-, mixed-, and ice-phase precipitation and cirrus sedimentation to cloud droplet and ice crystal number are estimated. The estimation accounts for microphysical adjustments to the initial perturbation in N. For warm rain, dlnP/dlnN < -2aut/(aut + acc) is found, which depends on the rates of autoconversion (aut) and accretion (acc). Cirrus sedimentation susceptibility corresponds to the exponent of crystal sedimentation velocity with a value of -0.2. For mixed-phase clouds, several microphysical contributions that explain low precipitation susceptibilities are identified: (i) Because of the larger hydrometeor sizes involved, mixed-phase collection processes are less sensitive to changes in hydrometeor size than auto conversion. (ii) Only a subset of precipitation formation processes is sensitive to droplet or crystal number. (iii) Effects on collection processes and diffusional growth compensate. (iv) Adjustments in cloud liquid and ice amount compensate the effect of changes in ice crystal and cloud droplet number.

abstract="Global coupled climate models have large long-standing cloud and radiation biases, calling into question their ability to simulate climate and climate change. This study assesses the impact of reducing shortwave radiation biases on climate sensitivity within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The model is modified by increasing supercooled cloud liquid to better match absorbed shortwave radiation observations over the Southern Ocean while tuning to reduce a compensating tropical shortwave bias. With a thermodynamic mixed-layer ocean, equilibrium warming in response to doubled CO2 increases from 4.1 K in the control to 5.6 K in the modified model. This 1.5 K increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity is caused by changes in two extratropical shortwave cloud feedbacks. First, reduced conversion of cloud ice to liquid at high southern latitudes decreases the magnitude of a negative cloud phase feedback. Second, warming is amplified in the mid-latitudes by a larger positive shortwave cloud feedback. The positive cloud feedback, usually associated with the subtropics, arises when sea surface warming increases the moisture gradient between the boundary layer and free troposphere. The increased moisture gradient enhances the effectiveness of mixing to dry the boundary layer, which decreases cloud amount and optical depth. When a full-depth ocean with dynamics and thermodynamics is included, ocean heat uptake preferentially cools the mid-latitude Southern Ocean, partially inhibiting the positive cloud feedback and slowing warming. Overall, the results highlight strong connections between Southern Ocean mixed-phase cloud partitioning, cloud feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake in a climate forced by greenhouse gas changes.",

abstract="In this study, it is shown that CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) that convert supercooled water to ice at relatively warm temperatures tend to have a greater mean-state cloud fraction and more negative cloud feedback in the middle and high latitude Southern Hemisphere. We investigate possible reasons for these relationships by analyzing the mixed-phase parameterizations in 26 GCMs. The atmospheric temperature where ice and liquid are equally prevalent (T5050) is used to characterize the mixed-phase parameterization in each GCM. Liquid clouds have a higher albedo than ice clouds, so, all else being equal, models with more supercooled liquid water would also have a higher planetary albedo. The lower cloud fraction in these models compensates the higher cloud reflectivity and results in clouds that reflect shortwave radiation (SW) in reasonable agreement with observations, but gives clouds that are too bright and too few. The temperature at which supercooled liquid can remain unfrozen is strongly anti-correlated with cloud fraction in the climate mean state across the model ensemble, but we know of no robust physical mechanism to explain this behavior, especially because this anti-correlation extends through the subtropics. A set of perturbed physics simulations with the Community Atmospheric Model Version 4 (CAM4) shows that, if its temperature-dependent phase partitioning is varied and the critical relative humidity for cloud formation in each model run is also tuned to bring reflected SW into agreement with observations, then cloud fraction increases and liquid water path (LWP) decreases with T5050, as in the CMIP5 ensemble.",

By embedding a lidar simulator within CAM5, the idiosyncrasies of spaceborne lidar cloud detection and phase assignment are replicated. As a result, this study makes scale-aware and definition-aware comparisons between model-simulated and observed cloud amount and cloud phase. In the global mean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud and excessive ice cloud when compared to CALIPSO observations. Over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud in all seasons. Having important implications for projections of future sea level rise, a liquid cloud deficit contributes to a cold bias of 2-3 degrees C for summer daily maximum near-surface air temperatures at Summit, Greenland. Over themidlatitude stormtracks, CAM5 has excessive ice cloud and insufficient liquid cloud. Storm track cloud phase biases in CAM5 maximize over the Southern Ocean, which also has larger-than-observed seasonal variations in cloud phase. Physical parameter modifications reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint. The results also highlight the importance of using a regime-based, as opposed to a geographic-based, model evaluation approach. More generally, the results demonstrate the importance and value of simulator-enabled comparisons of cloud phase in models used for future climate projection.",

abstract="Increasing optical depth poleward of 45 degrees is a robust response to warming in global climate models. Much of this cloud optical depth increase has been hypothesized to be due to transitions from ice-dominated to liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud. In this study, the importance of liquid-ice partitioning for the optical depth feedback is quantified for 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. All models show a monotonic partitioning of ice and liquid as a function of temperature, but the temperature at which ice and liquid are equally mixed (the glaciation temperature) varies by as much as 40K across models. Models that have a higher glaciation temperature are found to have a smaller climatological liquid water path (LWP) and condensed water path and experience a larger increase in LWP as the climate warms. The ice-liquid partitioning curve of each model may be used to calculate the response of LWP to warming. It is found that the repartitioning between ice and liquid in a warming climate contributes at least 20\% to 80\% of the increase in LWP as the climate warms, depending on model. Intermodel differences in the climatological partitioning between ice and liquid are estimated to contribute at least 20\% to the intermodel spread in the high-latitude LWP response in the mixed-phase region poleward of 45 degrees S. It is hypothesized that a more thorough evaluation and constraint of global climate model mixed-phase cloud parameterizations and validation of the total condensate and ice-liquid apportionment against observations will yield a substantial reduction in model uncertainty in the high-latitude cloud response to warming.",

ACI are sensitive to both cloud microphysical processes (the ``C'' in ACI) and aerosol emissions and processes (the ``A'' in ACI). This work highlights the importance of cloud microphysical processes, using idealized and global tests of a cloud microphysics scheme used for global climate prediction. Uncertainties in key cloud microphysical processes examined with sensitivity tests cause uncertainties of nearly -30 to +60\% in ACI, similar to or stronger than uncertainties identified due to natural aerosol emissions (-30 to +30 \%). The different dimensions and sensitivities of ACI to microphysical processes identified in previous work are analyzed in detail, showing that precipitation processes are critical for understanding ACI and that uncertain cloud lifetime effects are nearly one-third of simulated ACI. Buffering of different processes is important, as is the mixed phase and coupling of the microphysics to the condensation and turbulence schemes in the model.},

	Abstract = {Cloud microphysical process rates control the amount of condensed water in clouds and impact the susceptibility of precipitation to cloud-drop number and aerosols. The relative importance of different microphysical processes in a climate model is analyzed, and the autoconversion and accretion processes are found to be critical to the condensate budget in most regions. A simple steady-state model of warm rain formation is used to illustrate that the diagnostic rain formulations typical of climate models may result in excessive contributions from autoconversion, compared to observations and large eddy simulation models with explicit bin-resolved microphysics and rain formation processes. The behavior does not appear to be caused by the bulk process rate formulations themselves, because the steady-state model with the same bulk accretion and autoconversion has reduced contributions from autoconversion. Sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze how perturbations to the precipitation microphysics for stratiform clouds impact process rates, precipitation susceptibility and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). With similar liquid water path, corrections for the diagnostic rain assumptions in the GCM based on the steady-state model to boost accretion indicate that the radiative effects of ACI may decrease by 20\% in the GCM. Links between process rates, susceptibility and ACI are not always clear in the GCM. Better representation of the precipitation process, for example by prognosticating precipitation mass and number, may help better constrain these effects in global models with bulk microphysics schemes.},

abstract="Tropospheric aerosols are thought to have three important effects on the Earth's radiation budget: the direct radiative effect(1) (perturbation of clear-sky reflectivity), the indirect radiative effect(2) (modification of cloud albedo) and the effect on the hydrological cycle(3) (modification of the vertical thickness and horizontal extent of clouds). The first two effects have been understood in principle for nearly 20 years, and quantitative estimates of their magnitudes have been provided by models and observations(4). The third phenomenon, and its relation to the other two, has received far less attention. Previous work(3) has shown, however, that increases in aerosol concentration may act to increase cloud albedo by increasing horizontal cloud fraction as well as cloud reflectivity. Here we use a simple model of the marine cloud-topped boundary layer to investigate the changes in cloud thickness and albedo that result from changes in precipitation as particle concentrations vary. We find that the sensitivity of layer cloud albedo to droplet number concentration (the albedo susceptibility) is increased by 50-200\% when the dependence of cloud thickness on particle number is included. The results suggest that the response of cloud thickness to changes in aerosol particle concentration must be taken into account for accurate prediction of global albedo by climate models.",

abstract="This is the second of two observational papers examining drizzle in stratiform boundary layer clouds. Part I details the vertical and horizontal structure of cloud and drizzle parameters, including some bulk microphysical variables. In this paper, the focus is on the in situ size-resolved microphysical measurements, particularly of drizzle drops (r > 20 mu m). Layer-averaged size distributions of drizzle drops within cloud are shown to be well represented using either a truncated exponential or a truncated lognormal size distribution. The size-resolved microphysical measurements are used to estimate autoconversion and accretion rates by integration of the stochastic collection equation (SCE). These rates are compared with a number of commonly used bulk parameterizations of warm rain formation. While parameterized accretion rates agree well with those derived from the SCE initialized with observed spectra, the autoconversion rates seriously disagree in some cases. These disagreements need to be addressed in order to bolster confidence in large-scale numerical model predictions of the aerosol second indirect effect. Cloud droplet coalescence removal rates and mass and number fall rate relationships used in the bulk microphysical schemes are also compared, revealing some potentially important discrepancies. The relative roles of autoconversion and accretion are estimated by examination of composite profiles from the 12 flights. Autoconversion, although necessary for the production of drizzle drops, is much less important than accretion throughout the lower 80\% of the cloud layer in terms of the production of drizzle liquid water. The SCE calculations indicate that the autoconversion rate depends strongly upon the cloud droplet concentration N-d such that a doubling of N-d would lead to a reduction in autoconversion rate of between 2 and 4. Radar reflectivity-precipitation rate (Z-R) relationships suitable for radar use are derived and are shown to be significantly biased in some cases by the undersampling of large (r > 200 mu m) drops with the 2D-C probe. A correction based upon the extrapolation to larger sizes using the exponential size distribution changes the Z-R relationship, leading to the conclusion that consideration should be given to sampling issues when examining higher moments of the drop size distribution in drizzling stratiform boundary layer clouds.",

abstract="Radiative forcing is a useful tool for predicting equilibrium global temperature change. However, it is not so useful for predicting global precipitation changes, as changes in precipitation strongly depend on the climate change mechanism and how it perturbs the atmospheric and surface energy budgets. Here a suite of climate model experiments and radiative transfer calculations are used to quantify and assess this dependency across a range of climate change mechanisms. It is shown that the precipitation response can be split into two parts: a fast atmospheric response that strongly correlates with the atmospheric component of radiative forcing, and a slower response to global surface temperature change that is independent of the climate change mechanism, similar to 2-3\% per unit of global surface temperature change. We highlight the precipitation response to black carbon aerosol forcing as falling within this range despite having an equilibrium response that is of opposite sign to the radiative forcing and global temperature change.

abstract="Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) robustly predict that the rate of increase in global-mean precipitation with global-mean surface temperature increase is much less than the rate of increase of water vapor. The goal of this paper is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which precipitation increase is constrained by radiative cooling. Changes in clear-sky atmospheric radiative cooling resulting from changes in temperature and humidity in global warming simulations are in good agreement with the multimodel, global-mean precipitation increase projected by GCMs (similar to 1.1 W m(-2) K-1).In an atmosphere with fixed specific humidity, radiative cooling from the top of the atmosphere (TOA) increases in response to a uniform temperature increase of the surface and atmosphere, while atmospheric cooling by exchange with the surface decreases because the upward emission of longwave radiation from the surface increases more than the downward longwave radiation from the atmosphere. When a fixed relative humidity (RH) assumption is made, however, uniform warming causes a much smaller increase of cooling at the TOA, and the surface contribution reverses to an increase in net cooling rate due to increased downward emission from water vapor. Sensitivity of precipitation changes to lapse rate changes is modest when RH is fixed. Carbon dioxide reduces TOA emission with only weak effects on surface fluxes, and thus suppresses precipitation. The net atmospheric cooling response and thereby the precipitation response to CO2-induced warming at fixed RH are mostly contributed by changes in surface fluxes. The role of clouds is discussed.Intermodel spread in the rate of precipitation increase across the CMIP5 simulations is attributed to differences in the atmospheric cooling.",

The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends realistically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number density, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in relative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized precipitating cumulus cloud field is small.",

At the same time, it is still considerably lower than the 6.5 to 7\% K-1 decrease of the water vapor concentration with cooling from anthropogenic aerosol because the water vapor radiative feedback lowers the hydrological sensitivity to anthropogenic forcings. When GHG and aerosol forcings are combined, the climate models with a realistic 20th century warming indicate that the global mean precipitation increase due to GHG warming has, until recently, been completely masked by aerosol drying. This explains the apparent lack of sensitivity of the global mean precipitation to the net global warming recently found in observations.

The characteristics examined include the mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal-to-interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM; version 2.3.2a), produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal, and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95\% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low latitudes, in contrast to 45\%-65\% in convective form in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to the unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local SST, which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Nino-3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage of the contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm day(-1)), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (> 20 mm day(-1)) and overestimate them for light (< 10 mm day(-1)) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm day(-1) category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America is comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm day(-1)) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in these new models and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of the world's coupled climate models.",

    abstract = { Abstract Observational studies indicate that a mass flux approach may provide a realistic framework for cumulus parameterization in large-scale models, but this approach, through the introduction of a spectral cloud ensemble, leads normally to rather complex schemes. In this paper the question is addressed whether much simpler schemes can already provide realistic values of the thermal forcing by convection under various synoptic conditions. This is done through verifying such a scheme first on data from field experiments for periods of tropical penetrative convection (GATE, Marshall Islands), tradewind cumuli (ATEX, BOMEX) and extratropical organized convection (SESAME-79) and then in a NWP model. The scheme considers a population of clouds where the cloud ensemble is described by a one-dimensional bulk model as earlier applied by Yanai et al. in a diagnostic study of tropical convection. Cumulus scale downdrafts are included. Various types of convection are represented, i.e., penetrative convection in connection with large-scale convergent flow, shallow convection in suppressed conditions like tradewind cumuli and midlevel convection like extratropical organized convection associated with potentially unstable air above the boundary layer and large-scale ascent. The closure assumptions for determining the bulk cloud mass flux are: penetrative convection and midlevel convection are maintained by large-scale moisture convergence and shallow convection by supply of moisture due to surface evaporation. The parameterization produces realistic fields of convective heating and appears to be in fair balance with real data for NWP as it does not initiate strong adjustment processes (spinup) in global form. }

abstract="Most global climate models parameterize separate cloud types using separate parameterizations. This approach has several disadvantages, including obscure interactions between parameterizations and inaccurate triggering of cumulus parameterizations. Alternatively, a unified cloud parameterization uses one equation set to represent all cloud types. Such cloud types include stratiform liquid and ice cloud, shallow convective cloud, and deep convective cloud. Vital to the success of a unified parameterization is a general interface between clouds and microphysics. One such interface involves drawing Monte Carlo samples of subgrid variability of temperature, water vapor, cloud liquid, and cloud ice, and feeding the sample points into a microphysics scheme. This study evaluates a unified cloud parameterization and a Monte Carlo microphysics interface that has been implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5.3. Model computational expense is estimated, and sensitivity to the number of subcolumns is investigated. Results describing the mean climate and tropical variability from global simulations are presented. The new model shows a degradation in precipitation skill but improvements in short-wave cloud forcing, liquid water path, long-wave cloud forcing, precipitable water, and tropical wave simulation.",

abstract="Because of its extensive quality control procedures and uniform space-time grid, the NCEP Stage IV merged Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radar and surface rain gauge dataset is often considered to be the best long-term gridded dataset of precipitation observations covering the contiguous United States. Stage IV accumulations are employed in a variety of applications, and while the WSR-88D systems are well suited for observing heavy rain events that are likely to affect flooding, limitations in surface radar and gauge measurements can result in missed precipitation, especially near topography and in the western United States. This paper compares hourly Stage IV observations of precipitation occurrence to collocated observations from the 94-GHz CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar, which provides excellent sensitivity to light and frozen precipitation. Statistics from 4 yr of comparisons show that the CloudSat observes precipitation considerably more frequently than the Stage IV dataset, especially in northern states where frozen precipitation is prevalent in the cold season. The skill of Stage IV for precipitation detection is found to decline rapidly when the near-surface air temperature falls below 0 degrees C. As a result, agreement between Stage IV and CloudSat tends to be best in the southeast, where radar coverage is good and moderate-to-heavy liquid precipitation dominates. Stage IV and CloudSat precipitation detection characteristics are documented for each of the individual river forecast centers that contribute to the Stage IV dataset to provide guidance regarding potential sampling biases that may impact hydrologic applications.",

abstract="A coupled sulfur chemistry-cloud microphysics scheme (COUPL) is used to study the impact of sulfate aerosols on cloud lifetime and albedo. The cloud microphysics scheme includes precipitation formation, which depends on the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and on the liquid water content. On the basis of different observational data sets, CDNC is proportional to the sulfate aerosol mass, which is calculated by the model. Cloud cover is a function of relative humidity only. Additional sensitivity experiments with another cloud cover parameterization (COUPL-CC), which also depends on cloud water, and with a different autoconversion rate of cloud droplets (COUPL-CC-Aut) are conducted to investigate the range of the indirect effect due to uncertainties in cloud physics. For each experiment, two simulations, one using present-day and one using preindustrial sulfur emissions are carried out. The increase in liquid water path, cloud cover, and shortwave cloud forcing due to anthropogenic sulfur emissions depends crucially upon the parameterization of cloud cover and autoconversion of cloud droplets. In COUPL the liquid water path increases by 17\% and cloud cover increases by 1\% because of anthropogenic sulfur emissions, yielding an increase in shortwave cloud forcing of -1.4 W m(-2). In COUPL-CC the liquid water path increases by 32\%, cloud cover increases by 3\% and thus shortwave cloud forcing increases by -4.8 W m(-2). This large effect is caused by the strong dependence of cloud cover on cloud water and of the autoconversion rate on CDNC, cloud water, and cloud cover. Choosing a different autoconversion rate (COUPL-CC-Aut) with a reduced dependence on CDNC and cloud water results in an increase of liquid water path by only 11\% and of cloud cover by 1\%, and the increase in shortwave cloud forcing amounts to -2.2 W m(-2). These results clearly show that the uncertainties linked to the indirect aerosol effect are higher than was previously suggested.",

abstract="Deficiencies in the parameterizations of convection used in global climate models often lead to a distorted representation of the simulated rainfall intensity distribution (i.e., too much rainfall from weak rain rates). While encouraging improvements in high percentile rainfall intensity have been found as the horizontal resolution of the Community Atmosphere Model is increased to similar to 25 km, we demonstrate no corresponding improvement in the moderate rain rates that generate the majority of accumulated rainfall. Using a statistical framework designed to emphasize links between precipitation intensity and accumulated rainfall beyond just the frequency distribution, we show that CAM cannot realistically simulate moderate rain rates, and cannot capture their intensification with climate change, even as resolution is increased. However, by separating the parameterized convective and large-scale resolved contributions to total rainfall, we find that the intensity, geographic pattern, and climate change response of CAM's large-scale rain rates are more consistent with observations (TRMM 3B42), superparameterization, and theoretical expectations, despite issues with parameterized convection. Increasing CAM's horizontal resolution does improve the representation of total rainfall intensity, but not due to changes in the intensity of large-scale rain rates, which are surprisingly insensitive to horizontal resolution. Rather, improvements occur through an increase in the relative contribution of the large-scale component to the total amount of accumulated rainfall. Analysis of sensitivities to convective timescale and entrainment rate confirm the importance of these parameters in the possible development of scale-aware parameterizations, but also reveal unrecognized trade-offs from the entanglement of precipitation frequency and total amount.",

abstract="Assessments of the influence of aerosol emissions from human activities on the radiation budget, in particular via the modification of cloud properties, have been a challenge. In light of the variability to both aerosol properties and environmental properties affected by aerosols, observational evidence alone cannot provide accurate and global answers, because detailed observations are locally limited and/or lack statistical significance. Thus, current understanding is predominantly derived from simulations with global models. General discrepancies to envelope (backward) modeling, however, suggest that many aerosol processes in global (forward) modeling are not properly considered. Using analytically derived parameterizations is recommended wherever possible. If an analytical method does not exist or is too demanding computationally, laboratory results augmented by field data are the second-best approach. For the constraint of so-derived parameterizations at the GCM scale, evaluating individual parameterizations using statistical relationships of satellite-retrieved quantities relevant to the process is recommended. The set of parameterizations may also be evaluated and improved using the data assimilation technique. To improve the quality of data references to modeling, there is a need to link available atmospheric data from all scales, and establish and support validation networks and experiments, and a commitment to fine-tune and improve satellite retrievals in an iterative process even beyond the anticipated period of the mission. Only then can more reliable estimates of the indirect aerosol effect be expected.",

abstract="The cooling of the Earth's climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth's surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources-such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships-reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23\% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate.",

Studies have indicated that model estimates of cloud susceptibility to aerosols frequently exceed satellite estimates, motivating model reformulations to increase agreement. Here we show that conventional ways of using satellite information to estimate susceptibility can serve as only a weak constraint on models because the estimation is sensitive to errors in the retrieval procedures. Using instrument simulators to investigate differences between model and satellite estimates of susceptibilities, we find that low aerosol loading conditions are not well characterized by satellites, but model clouds are sensitive to aerosol perturbations in these conditions. We quantify the observational requirements needed to constrain models, and find that the nighttime lidar measurements of aerosols provide a better characterization of tenuous aerosols. We conclude that observational uncertainties and limitations need to be accounted for when assessing the role of aerosols in the climate system.",

abstract="A common problem in climate models is that they are likely to produce rain at a faster rate than is observed and therefore produce too much light rain (e.g., drizzle). Interestingly, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) multiscale modeling framework (MMF), whose warm-rain formation process is more realistic than other global models, has the opposite problem: the rain formation process in PNNL-MMF is less efficient than the real world. To better understand the microphysical processes in warm cloud, this study documents the model biases in PNNL-MMF and evaluates warm cloud properties, subgrid variability, and microphysics, using A-Train satellite observations to identify sources of model biases in PNNL-MMF. Like other models PNNL-MMF underpredicts the warm cloud fraction with compensating large optical depths. Associated with these compensating errors in cloudiness are compensating errors in the precipitation process. For a given liquid water path, clouds in the PNNL-MMF are less likely to produce rain than are real-world clouds. However, when the model does produce rain it is able to produce stronger precipitation than reality. As a result PNNL-MMF produces about the correct mean rain rate with an incorrect distribution of rates. The subgrid variability in PNNL-MMF is also tested, and results are fairly consistent with observations, suggesting that the possible sources of model biases are likely to be due to errors in its microphysics or dynamics rather than errors in the subgrid-scale variability produced by the embedded cloud resolving model.",

Methodologies developed to analyze CloudSat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations are employed to investigate the cloud-to-precipitation process of warm clouds and are applied to the model results to examine how the models represent the process for warm stratiform clouds. Despite a limitation of the present study that compares the statistics for stratiform clouds in climate models with those from satellite observations, including both stratiform and (shallow) convective clouds, the statistics constructed with the methodologies are compared between the models and satellite observations to expose their similarities and differences. A problem common to some models is that they tend to produce rain at a faster rate than is observed. These model characteristics are further examined in the context of cloud microphysics parameterizations using a simplified one-dimensional model of warm rain formation that isolates key microphysical processes from full interactions with other processes in global climate models. The one-dimensional model equivalent statistics reproduce key characteristics of the global model statistics when corresponding autoconversion schemes are assumed in the one-dimensional model. The global model characteristics depicted by the statistics are then interpreted as reflecting behaviors of the autoconversion parameterizations adopted in the models. Comparisons of the one-dimensional model with satellite observations hint at improvements to the formulation of the parameterization scheme, thus offering a novel way of constraining key parameters in autoconversion schemes of global models.",

They constitute the largest source of uncertainty in predictions of climatic change and hamper the ability of numerical weather prediction models to forecast high-impact weather events. The joint European Space Agency (ESA)-Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, will help to resolve these weaknesses by providing global profiles of cloud, aerosol, precipitation, and associated radiative properties inferred from a combination of measurements made by its collocated active and passive sensors. EarthCARE will improve our understanding of cloud and aerosol processes by extending the invaluable dataset acquired by the A-Train satellites CloudSat, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and Aqua. Specifically, EarthCARE's cloud profiling radar, with 7 dB more sensitivity than CloudSat, will detect more thin clouds and its Doppler capability will provide novel information on convection, precipitating ice particle, and raindrop fall speeds. EarthCARE's 355-nm high-spectral-resolution lidar will measure directly and accurately cloud and aerosol extinction and optical depth. Combining this with backscatter and polarization information should lead to an unprecedented ability to identify aerosol type. The multispectral imager will provide a context for, and the ability to construct, the cloud and aerosol distribution in 3D domains around the narrow 2D retrieved cross section. The consistency of the retrievals will be assessed to within a target of +/- 10 W m(-2) on the (10 km)(2) scale by comparing the multiview broadband radiometer observations to the top-of-atmosphere fluxes estimated by 3D radiative transfer models acting on retrieved 3D domains.",

We obtain a global-mean value of −0.28 W m−2, compared to −0.71 W m−2 with the autoconversion treatment most often used in climate models. The difference is due to (1) the new scheme's smaller autoconversion rate, and (2) an autoconversion threshold that increases more slowly with cloud droplet concentration. The impact of the smaller autoconversion rate shows the importance of accurately modeling this process.

Aerosol radiative forcing from pre-industrial time to the present due to the effect of atmospheric aerosol levels on the micro- and macrophysics of clouds bears the largest uncertainty among external influences on climate change(1). Of all cloud forms, low-level marine clouds exert the largest impact on the planet's albedo(2). For example, a 6\% increase in the albedo of global marine stratiform clouds could offset the warming that would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations(3). Marine warm cloud properties are thought to depend on aerosol levels and large-scale dynamic or thermodynamic states(4-6). Here we present a comprehensive analysis of multiple measurements from the A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites, to quantify the radiative forcing exerted by aerosols interacting with marine clouds. Specifically, we analyse observations of co-located aerosols and clouds over the world's oceans for the period August 2006-April 2011, comprising over 7.3 million CloudSat single-layer marine warm cloud pixels. We find that thermodynamic conditions-that is, tropospheric stability and humidity in the free troposphere-and the state of precipitation act together to govern the cloud liquid water responses to the presence of aerosols and the strength of aerosol-cloud radiative forcing.},

We use a large set of atmosphere-only climate change simulations (amip and amip-p4K) to separate the contributions to the differences in feedback parameter from all the atmospheric model developments between the two latest model configurations. We show that the differences are mostly driven by changes in the shortwave cloud radiative feedback in the midlatitudes, mainly over the Southern Ocean. Two new schemes explain most of the differences: the introduction of a new aerosol scheme and the development of a new mixed-phase cloud scheme. Both schemes reduce the strength of the preexisting shortwave negative cloud feedback in the midlatitudes. The new aerosol scheme dampens a strong aerosol-cloud interaction, and it also suppresses a negative clear-sky shortwave feedback. The mixed-phase scheme increases the amount of cloud liquid water path (LWP) in the present day and reduces the increase in LWP with warming. Both changes contribute to reducing the negative radiative feedback of the increase of LWP in the warmer climate. The mixed-phase scheme also enhances a strong, preexisting, positive cloud fraction feedback. We assess the realism of the changes by comparing present-day simulations against observations and discuss avenues that could help constrain the relevant processes.",

This ``mixed-phase feedback'' is normally attributed to a feedback caused by a phase change feedback (ice to liquid). Here we use an aquaplanet configuration to investigate this in more detail. We use high-frequency instantaneous diagnostics and composite them in ascending and descending regimes. We find that a large fraction of the increase in cloud liquid water in the mixed-phase region does not significantly contribute to the radiative feedback due to a masking effect of the ice cloud above. Using some simple arguments and approximate calculations, we estimate that about one third of the total shortwave negative radiative feedback is driven by a phase change feedback, whereas the rest of the feedback is driven by changes in ice and warm liquid clouds. Plain Language Summary Climate models show a robust increase in cloud reflectivity over the Southern Ocean under climate change. This increase acts as a negative feedback by reducing the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed by the system. This feedback is normally attributed to a cloud phase change as the climate warms, with liquid clouds being more reflective and thicker than the ice clouds in the control climate. Here we investigate this feedback process by using idealized simulations of an aquaplanet (no continents or sea ice). The results show that ice clouds above the liquid clouds mask the radiative effect of the liquid clouds and affect the strength of the feedback.",

The authors use information from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar to investigate in more detail the properties of the midlevel cloud regime. Most of the model biases occur in the cold-air side of the cyclone composite, and the cyclone composite accounts for most of the climatological error in that latitudinal band. The midlevel regime is the main contributor to reflected shortwave radiation biases. CALIPSO data show that the midlevel cloud regime is dominated by two main cloud types: cloud with tops actually at midlevel and low-level cloud. Improving the simulation of these cloud types should help reduce the biases in the simulation of the solar radiation budget in the Southern Ocean in climate models.",

abstract="The authors study the role of clouds in the persistent bias of surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR) in the Southern Ocean in the atmosphere-only version of the Met Office model. The reduction of this bias in the atmosphere-only version is important to minimize sea surface temperature biases when the atmosphere model is coupled to a dynamic ocean. The authors use cloud properties and radiative fluxes estimates from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and apply a clustering technique to classify clouds into different regimes over the Southern Ocean. Then, they composite the cloud regimes around cyclone centers, which allows them to study the role of each cloud regime in a mean composite cyclone. Low- and midlevel clouds in the cold-air sector of the cyclones are responsible for most of the bias. Based on this analysis; the authors develop and test a new diagnosis of shear-dominated boundary layers. This change improves the Simulation of the SDSR through a better simulation of the frequency of occurrence of the cloud regimes in the cyclone composite. Substantial biases in the radiative properties of the midtop and stratocumulus regimes are still present, which suggests the need to increase the optical depth of the low-level cloud with moderate optical depth and cloud with tops at midlevels.",

abstract="A previous study explored land-ocean differences in the warm-rain formation process. In that study, aerosol effects were removed, or at least partially removed, but some land-ocean differences remained. Therefore, the study hypothesized that the land-ocean difference in the microphysical structure of warm clouds and in the formation of warm rain can be explained by differences in the nature of updraughts. To test this hypothesis, this study provides a detailed analysis of the land-ocean differences in warm clouds using a combination of CloudSat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, ground-based measurements obtained from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM), as well as a simple model framework. Our results show that a stronger updraught increases the height at which significant coalescence begins, and also prolongs the lifetime of falling drops promoting larger droplet growth. A consequence of this difference is that drizzle is less frequently observed at cloud base over land. Our results point to the critical role of the strength of the convective updraught in the warm-rain formation process.",

abstract="Quantifying the sensitivity of warm rain to aerosols is important for constraining climate model estimates of aerosol indirect effects. In this study, the precipitation sensitivity to cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) in satellite retrievals is quantified by applying the precipitation susceptibility metric to a combined CloudSat/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data set of stratus and stratocumulus clouds that cover the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Consistent with previous observational studies of marine stratocumulus, precipitation susceptibility decreases with increasing liquid water path (LWP), and the susceptibility of the mean precipitation rate R is nearly equal to the sum of the susceptibilities of precipitation intensity and of probability of precipitation. Consistent with previous modeling studies, the satellite retrievals reveal that precipitation susceptibility varies not only with LWP but also with N-d. Puzzlingly, negative values of precipitation susceptibility are found at low LWP and high N-d. There is marked regional variation in precipitation susceptibility values that cannot simply be explained by regional variations in LWP and N-d. This suggests other controls on precipitation apart from LWP and N-d and that precipitation susceptibility will need to be quantified and understood at the regional scale when relating to its role in controlling possible aerosol-induced cloud lifetime effects.",

abstract="Spatial variability of liquid cloud water content and rainwater content is analysed from three different observational platforms: in situ measurements from research aircraft, land-based remote sensing techniques using radar and lidar, and spaceborne remote sensing from CloudSat. The variance is found to increase with spatial scale, but also depends strongly on the cloud or rain fraction regime, with overcast regions containing less variability than broken cloud fields. This variability is shown to lead to large biases, up to a factor of 4, in both the autoconversion and accretion rates estimated at a model grid scale of approximate to 40 km by a typical microphysical parametrization using in-cloud mean values. A parametrization for the subgrid variability of liquid cloud and rainwater content is developed, based on the observations, which varies with both the grid scale and cloud or rain fraction, and is applicable for all model grid scales. It is then shown that if this parametrization of the variability is analytically incorporated into the autoconversion and accretion rate calculations, the bias is significantly reduced.",

abstract="A microphysical parameterization for shallow cumulus and boundary layer stratocumulus clouds has been developed. Similar to the Khairoutdinov and Kogan parameterization for stratocumulus clouds, the new parameterization is based on an explicit microphysical large-eddy simulation (LES) model as a data source and benchmark for comparison. The predictions of the bulk model using the new parameterization were tested in simulations of shallow cumulus and boundary layer stratocumulus clouds; in both cases the new parameterization matched the predictions of the explicit microphysics LES quite accurately. These results show the importance of the choice of the dataset in parameterization development and the need for it to be balanced by realistic dynamic conditions. The strong sensitivity to representation of rain evaporation is also demonstrated. Accurate formulation of this process, tuned for the case of cumulus convection, has substantially improved precision of rain production.",

abstract="Mixed-phase clouds (clouds that consist of both cloud droplets and ice crystals) are frequently present in the Earth's atmosphere and influence the Earth's energy budget through their radiative properties, which are highly dependent on the cloud water phase. In this study, the phase partitioning of cloud water is compared among six global climate models (GCMs) and with Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization retrievals. It is found that the GCMs predict vastly different distributions of cloud phase for a given temperature, and none of them are capable of reproducing the spatial distribution or magnitude of the observed phase partitioning. While some GCMs produced liquid water paths comparable to satellite observations, they all failed to preserve sufficient liquid water at mixed-phase cloud temperatures. Our results suggest that validating GCMs using only the vertically integrated water contents could lead to amplified differences in cloud radiative feedback. The sensitivity of the simulated cloud phase in GCMs to the choice of heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization is also investigated. The response to a change in ice nucleation is quite different for each GCM, and the implementation of the same ice nucleation parameterization in all models does not reduce the spread in simulated phase among GCMs. The results suggest that processes subsequent to ice nucleation are at least as important in determining phase and should be the focus of future studies aimed at understanding and reducing differences among the models.",

volume="117",
pages="D02207",
abstract="Coalescence of cloud droplets is essential for the production of small raindrops at a given vertical distance above the cloud base (D-p). The rate of droplet coalescence is determined mainly by droplet size, spectrum width and concentrations. The droplet condensational growth is determined by the number of activated CCN (N-a) and height above cloud base. Here we show that when the droplet mean volume radius, r(v), exceeds similar to 13 mu m, or when droplet effective radius (r(e)) exceeds similar to 14 mu m, considerable precipitation mass (>0.03 g kg(-1)) is likely to be present in growing convective clouds. This is because the rate of droplet coalescence is proportional to similar to r(v)(5) which practically implies the existence of a threshold r(v) above which efficient warm rain formation can occur, and also because the vertical profile of r(v), even in diluted clouds, nearly follows the theoretical adiabatic condensational growth curve. The small observed deviations are mainly caused by deviations from purely inhomogeneous mixing which cause partial droplet evaporation. Consequently, D-p must theoretically change nearly linearly with N-a. This is confirmed here observationally, where increasing N-a by 100 per milligram (approximate to cm(3) at cloud base) of air, resulted in an increase of similar to 280 m in D-p for both Israeli and Indian deep convective clouds. This means that in highly polluted clouds or where strong cloud-base updrafts occur, clouds have to grow well above the freezing level, even in tropical atmosphere, before precipitation forms either by warm or by mixed-phase processes.",
